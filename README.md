==================

This program is used to remove tables from text extracted from PDF or simple plaint text.

If you want to extract the text with this program, you need to get a copy of pdftotext and place it in the root directory of the compiled program.

Also, you need trained POI models if you want to tag the text. I have used Stanford NLP POS models. The error message will tell you what to get, or you simply edit the code.

To get all the used libraries, use the given buildfile together with Apache buildr.
